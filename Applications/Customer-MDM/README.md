## Overview 
![Katana](img/katanalogo.png "Katana")  

We've been hired by a fictitious auto manufacturing company called "Katana" to build a customer MDM application prototype.  Katana has a global market place consisting of automobile dealerships, online websites, and financial services for its customers of its two major brands. __"Katana"__ motors sells quality family vehicles, and its high end luxury brand __"Legacy"__ sells high performance extreemly high end luxury vehicles.  Each brand has its own set of dealerships and systems that repersent the customer in a variety of different ways.  Katana may have the same customer or the same customer household buying both brands and is unaware that these two apparently different customers may be the same individual buying cars for the same household.

You have been tasked to create a minimum viable product (MVP), a basic protype, of a customer MDM application across all dealerships and online sites for both Kanakata and Legacy brands. They wish to test both the functionality and performance of the application.  The functionality includes identifying a single customer from all systems and providing customer updates in real time to their third party dealerships and financing division.

Additionally Katana motors has been given the task of removing sensitive customer data from all its related transactional systems. The California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) and the Nevada Consumer Privacy Law requires Katana to remove all customer data from its many transactional systems if a customer "opts out" and does not want their identifiable data inside Katana.  The intent to change all the systems to identify the customer through a unique token generated in the Customer MDM and use only the token in all the related transactional systems.  When a transactional system needs to display customer information it will request that information via a rest based API to the Customer MDM application.  Should the customer opt out of Katana then only one system, the customer MDM, will need to remove the customer identifiable data.

The desire is to have a serverless REST based API layer to service the myriad of transactional systems that will not require any maintenance, and can scale automatically as demand increases with out human intervention.

Customer data will be loaded into the Customer MDM as new customers come into the website and sign up for promotional offerings.  Customer data will also come into the Customer MDM with nightly batch loads from Katana financial services for the previous days loan applications.  The two different dealerships also load prospective customers and customer purchase data when a vehicle is taken for a test drive or purchased.  All of these websites and dealerships have a variety of data formats.

Our job is to ingest data from all these sources and both preserve a record of the data as it exists in each of these systems as well as a master copy that reconciles the customer into a single view and golden source of truth across all of the systems.

## Data Flow
A basic data flow diagram was put together to solve the MDM problem.  The dealerships used a legacy system (source system A) which would require a nightly batch process and an ETL program to load data into mongo.  The Katana and Legacy online services (source systems B and C) have the ability to use a REST API and send JSON documents in real time.

MongoDB has three colections to manage the customer data.  As data comes in from the various sources they are loaded into a __"source"__ collection.  A grouping function is used to group customer data together in documents based on specified rules and criteria found in the source documents.  Once grouped together a new document is inserted into the __"group"__ collection.  A final process runs to pick which fields of the grouped source documents will be used in the master record.  The final master record is inserted into the __"master"__ collection.

## Sample Customer Document
Lets take a look at one of the documents produced from this process.  The master docuemnt has all the information relevant to the customer.  The master object has the fields that were selected from all the source systems.  Each of the source systems are listed in an array with the data as it currently is in each of the source systems.  We notice a few descrepancies between each of the systems. The email and physical addresses are different in some cases, and it looks like one system transposed the day and month of the customers birth date.

This tutorial will cover the entire process (except the ETL process) in the data flow diagram. We will create the REST API that allows the source data to be inserted from the micro services. We will create the basics of the grouping and mastering functions. 

We will create some additional components as well.  We will create a REST API service that will allow the master document to be queried and updated, with new source data merged and split as needed.  We will create a web based browser that uses the stitch SDK to create a broswer client with the full capabilities of stitch QueryAnywhere to access and manage the customer master data.
