## Overview 
![Kankata](html/kankata.png "Kankata")  

We've been hired by a fictitious auto manufacturing company called "Kankata" to build a customer MDM application prototype.  Kankata has a global market place consisting of automobile dealerships online websites and customers for its two major brands. Kankata motors sells quality family vehicles and its high end luxury brand Legacy motors sells high performance extreemly high end luxury vehicles.

You have been tasked to create a minimum viable product (MVP), a basic protype, of a customer MDM application across all dealerships and online sites for both brands Kanakat and Legacy. They wish to test both the functionality and performance of the application.  The functionality includes identifying a single customer from all systems and providing customer updates in real time to their third party dealerships and financing division.

Additionally Kankata motors has been given the task of removing sesnitive customer data from all its transaction systems.  The intent is to identify the customer through a unique token in the Customer MDM and use only the token in all the related transactional systems.  When a transaction system needs to display customer information it will request that information via a webservice that will communicate to the Customer MDM application through a rest API.

The desire is to have a serveless REST based API layer that will not require maintenance and can scale automatically as demand increases with out maintenance or human intervention.
