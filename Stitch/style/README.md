### Style sheets overview
Style sheets, also known as CSS files, are the gateway drug to development frameworks like Bootstrap, and then full on platforms like Angular and React. One devaites quickly from the path pure html and javascript into a dark and seedy developement underwold. Obviously CSS and these frameworks, development platforms provide rich beatiful interfaces, but at a small cost of complexity that was avoided in these initial tutorials.  Our plan is to provide tutorials for React in the future in this github repository. For now we devaite only slightly into the realm of CSS for a nice looking style.

### Adding a style sheet
The process begins innocently enough by inluding a style sheet.  Its a simple link.  Next we make slight modifications to some of the div and table classes. Then we simply gut the input table and replace it with __fieldset__ tags around our inputs.   

Lets get started.  We will need the [employee.html](../employee/employee.html) file from the [Atlas Triggers and Functions: HR Employee tutorial](https://github.com/brittonlaroche/MongoDB-Demos/edit/master/Stitch/employee/) and our new css file right here in this directory [mystyle.css](mystyle.css). Copy both files into the text editor of your choice and save them in the same directory as employee.html and mystyle.css respectively.  If you finished the employee tutorial, you may use the employee.html file created in the tutorial earlier if you wish.  Simply add mystyle.css to the same directory.
