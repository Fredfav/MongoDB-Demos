## Atlas Charts Overview
In this short tutorial we are going to build some atlas charts on our employee data created in our HR application.  Once the charts are created we will embed them in our employee application.  Creating charts is very easy, it does not require any code, you can drag and drop fields and apply functions such as sum and count to create stunning charts in a matter of minutes.
